[Live Demo](https://learn-plus-ngo-next-js.vercel.app/)

**Tech Stack:** Next.js, TypeScript, Strapi (planned), Cloudinary (planned)

**Timeline:** Aug 2025 â€“ Present  
**Role:** Freelance Frontend Developer

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive website for **Learn Plus**, a Croatian NGO organizing Erasmus+ educational programs for participants across Europe. The platform features both representational content and a blog section.

The project is being developed in **phases**:

1. **Phase 1 (Almost Done):**
   - Static content and blog data are stored in Next.js.
   - Markdown is used for rendering blog content.
   - Fully responsive design with accessibility considerations.

2. **Phase 2 (Planned):**
   - Integration with **Strapi** as a headless CMS for dynamic content management.
   - **Cloudinary** for media asset management.

## Features

- Multi-section pages for NGO information and programs.
- Dynamic blog section (currently static, will move to Strapi).
- Fully responsive design.
- SEO-friendly metadata for pages.
- Optimized for performance, accessibility (a11y), and security best practices.

## Development Notes

- Frontend is built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.
- Markdown content is sanitized for security using `DOMPurify` and `rehype-sanitize`.
- Transition to Strapi will allow non-technical users to manage content easily.
- Cloudinary will handle all media assets in the second phase.

## Future Enhancements

- Admin authentication via Strapi.
- Integration of additional Erasmus+ project pages dynamically from Strapi.
